/*
 * GeigerNode, ATmega328PB-AU, 3.3 V.
 *
 * HV_SW is PB1 / OC1A. It drives the high-voltage converter transistor.
 * Firmware holds that pin low. Timer1 stays disabled, so OC1A stays disconnected.
 *
 * LED is PD7.
 * PD3 is spare and stays untouched.
 * Timer2, TWI0, ADC, and INT0 stay disabled during bring-up.
